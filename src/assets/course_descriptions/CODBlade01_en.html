    <p>Our Full Stack course is designed to provide comprehensive and in-depth training on all the technologies
        necessary to become a competent full stack developer. This course covers a wide range of topics, from basic
        programming and requirements analysis to creating complete and complex applications using back-end, front-end,
        and cloud technologies.</p>

    <h1>Course Description</h1>
    <p><strong>Introduction to Programming and UML:</strong><br>We start the course with an overview of fundamental
        programming concepts. We will use UML (Unified Modeling Language) to analyze and design software systems,
        facilitating the understanding of relationships and interactions between various components of the system.</p>

    <p><strong>C++ Language and OOP Concepts:</strong><br>We will then move on to learning the C++ language, a powerful
        programming language used in numerous fields. We will delve into object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts,
        such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are fundamental for developing modular and reusable
        software.</p>

    <p><strong>Databases and SQL Language:</strong><br>The course will continue with a section dedicated to databases.
        You will learn to design and manage relational databases, using the SQL language to perform create, read,
        update, and delete (CRUD) operations. This module is crucial for understanding how to manage and manipulate
        large amounts of data efficiently.</p>

    <h1>Back-End Language (C#, Java)</h1>
    <p>Next, we will introduce you to one of the main back-end programming languages: C# or Java. These languages are
        widely used for developing robust and scalable server-side applications. You will delve into concepts such as
        session management, security, and database integration.</p>

    <p><strong>Front-End Concepts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):</strong><br>The course also includes a section on the
        fundamentals of front-end development. You will learn to create interactive and responsive user interfaces using
        HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity. These tools are essential for developing
        modern web applications.</p>

    <p><strong>Cloud Concepts:</strong><br>Finally, we will explore the fundamental concepts of cloud computing. You
        will discover how to use cloud services to host applications, store data, and scale resources as needed. This
        section will prepare you to work with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, which have become
        indispensable in the current technological landscape.</p>
